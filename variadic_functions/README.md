# C - Variadic Functions

## Overview

This project delves into the world of variadic functions in the C programming language, exploring their usage and the essential macros `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`. Additionally, it covers the significance of the `const` type qualifier in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

By the completion of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of variadic functions and their application.
- Effectively use `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros in variadic functions.
- Grasp the purpose and practical use cases of the `const` type qualifier.
